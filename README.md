### Hola, It's me, Tomeu ðŸ‘‹

I have been working and playing with computers since I was a kid. I have always been fascinated by how much "magic" it was that with a few words you could create anything on the screen. I have been working as a Frontend Engineer for the past 5 years and am still excited when new challenges come along. I consider myself a friendly, passionate, and enthusiastic engineer ðŸ¤©
